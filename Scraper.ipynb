Only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the watch band, while it compliments the watch, is very small and barely fits around my wrist. My wrist is 8\" around, and the band is uncomfortably tight.

      "5.0 I bought the black version of this watch about a year ago. It has a large simple face( 42 mm) and is easy to read with large contrasting arabic numerals. It keeps time accurately. I set it a year ago and just checked it and it was just 15 seconds slow. So I liked the black one so much that I bought the green version two weeks ago. All I have said about the black one is true of the green version, but the green and gold is simply beautiful. For the quality the price is amazing. One problem is the low water resistance. I will make sure to not get them wet and absolutely no bathing or swimming. Another problem is no hacking, so it cannot be set to the second. edit: The new version does have hacking.  Finally although the black strap was comfortable from the beginning, the green strap was very stiff and took a bit of work to break it in. It is comfortable now.

      "4.0 I got it for my 75 yr old dad who thinks my obsession with watches is weird, but I love finding high value per dollar in ultra affordable watches too. My dad is frugal and likes that in his gifts, but low price doesn't have to mean junk. Also, he finds digitals tacky (so all the good low-end Casios were a no go).I found this Timex, \"scratch & dent\" on Amazon for just shy of $20, it arrived with  the box all beat up, the leather strap was not attached, and there were no spring bars. Still, the watch and strap were in brand new shape. I keep spare spring bars and it was easy to pop the strap on. Strap is on the short side, if you have larger than a 7.5\" wrist, you'll probably need a different one (a NATO would work well on it, imo). Also, watch is old school size, 35mm, so it may seem small by today's standards.Highly legible day or night, it's got indiglo back light, even though that can wear on the battery if used a lot, it does look sharp in the dark, especially for this price point. Water resistant enough you don't have to worry about getting it wet, but I wouldn't go swimming or shower with it.Watch hit everything my dad likes, Timex has quality choices for a budget watch, and it was still fun for me to find. Timex is not a brand I normally look at, but dad loves it and seeing it in hand, I feel good about the purchase.I rate 4 stars because it is a lot of watch for $20-30 bucks.

      "5.0 I've been looking for a casual watch for these past few months and this beauty is the one. I was lucky to come across this watch as I was just about to buy a $500 Citizen I had my eyes on from the last visit to the store. The saved money is real handy for a kid still in school. And I'm sure you've assumed already, I ended up buying the Timex Reader and I don't regret it.I already had an idea(a petty one) about what kind of watch I wanted. One with a leather strap, red second hand, simple ~40mm white face w/date, silver case. So it was awesome to find the Timex Reader. But after scrolling down the page and reading a few negative reviews about the absurd noise, pesky date setting and also the cheap price I was skeptical about the purchase. Whatever, I decided to just order it and see for myself.Here's my some information about the watch if you're considering buying it,The face:It's white, just like the picture. I only say this because other watches by Timex advertise online a white face but are actually a yellow-creamy hue.The Indiglo:It's the colour teal and it also doesn't entirely light up the face of the watch. There's about half a centimeter of unlit area at the top of the watch. Think of it like a nearly-filled fish tank. It's a feature I won't see myself using much, so I care little about the defect.The Band:It's not as brown as the picture would make you think. Some reviewers agree that it's a Maroon Red. When you actually zoom in on the image, you can see the red that I'm talking about. Just assume that it's reddish and not brown for expectations.The noise:I'm a student with a PC and a fan always running. So obviously this small watch won't over power the noise. With the watch up to my ear, of course I hear ticking but I personally find the repetitive sound soothing. Just a tip, apparently if you put the watch FACE down it some-what mutes the sound from what I read from some reviews.The time/date:What do you do when you get a watch? You set it's time. Right away, I was super frustrated with setting time and date with this watch like other reviewers. A little side story, I kept pulling and pulling the crown to get a certain time setting and the ENTIRE CROWN came out! It looked like a metal toothpick. I was confused about what the hell just happened and sorta like when you drop a vase and sweep it under the carpet, I immediately shoved the little guy back in the hole without much thought. I'm not very technical when it comes it watches which would explain why I'm sounding like a stooge.  Anyways, the watch still worked and I did end up figuring out how to set the time and it was a lot easier than I first thought. Throw away the instructions from the box and follow mine instructions below.How to set time:1. Set Day of Week (Thursday, Friday, etc.)Pull crown out and move it clockwise. If the time is being adjusted, you're doing it right. Keep turning it to get the right day of the week. For me I had to keep turning 3 full days, essentially 6 full 12 hour rotations.2. Set Date (1st, 4th, 29th, etc.)Pull crown out A LITTLE BIT. So little that there's barely a gap between it and the watch case. Then move the crown and you can set the date.3. Set Time (12:39, 1:04, etc.)Pull crown out normally just like when you set Day of Week and just set time as you would any other watch.By the way, when I say pull crown out, I don't mean entirely out of the watch like I did earlier. Once you pull out the crown and it seems it doesn't want to come out a centimeter more, then that's as far as it should go.Overall, great watch, great price, great buy.

      "3.0 The watch is easy to read, day or night, keeps fairly good time, but does not let you set the day of the week, nor provides instructions how to set it other than what is listed in the ad. Price is competitive. The large size works fine to make reading the time easy. The leather band is comfortable, and fits most wrists  unless you have a small wrist.

      "5.0 This is my second TIMEX.  Sent the first back as the hands were very hard to see in poor lighting. This watch with a white background and black hands is very easy to see.Only complaint was the leather band.  I found it very still and uncomfortable so I bought a new band.  Love the watch Amazon Customer Reviewed in Canada on June 2, 2024\n",
